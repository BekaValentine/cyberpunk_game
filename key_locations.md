## The Hackerspace

Named "The Helix", it's a version of DNA Lounge, but more like the Cyberdelia in Hackers, and with an actual hackerspace portion to it.

The space was previously an underground car park, with the hackerspace portion on the lowest level, but the middle level is the lounge area. There's also a helical car ramp that goes down from ground level to the two underground levels, which is what gives it its name.

The Helix should probably have some interesting connections to tunnels, maybe?
