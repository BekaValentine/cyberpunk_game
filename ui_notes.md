# UI Notes

## What Menus/UIs Are Necessary

- Main Menu/Pause Menu
  - Play/Continue
  - Exit
  - Settings
- Small Tool Case - black nylon lock pick case w/ small handheld tools, keys, etc.
- Phone or other device?? - for information retrieval
- Various devices (no computers, diagetic fullscreen)
- Cyberspace - for computers

## UI Types

### True Diagetic

Very rare for inventories of menus. More common for interactable items.

Looks like the appropriate thing in the world would look, e.g. a backpack full of stuff, a toolbox, etc. Organization is realistic.

Examples: Alien Isolation Computers

### Semi-Diagetic

Looks like an object in the world but doesn't actually make sense as storage. Some versions of this are cases of tools that look like the actual tools but the logic of them is like non-diagetic inventories. Other versions are computers that represent the inventory symbolically.

Examples: Full Fathom Inventory, Fallout Inventory

### Pseudo-Diagetic

Looks like its in the world, but doesn't pretend to be an object that makes any sense. It's just fixed to world space.

Examples: Dead Space Inventory

### Non-Diagetic

Doesn't pretend to be connected to the game world at all. It's just a menu or other actual UI element. Sometimes these are themed to *look* like objects, for aesthetic reasons, but there's no pretense that they're actual objects, that's just menu aesthetics.

Examples: Deus Ex (all) Inventory, *Shock Inventory, Thief Inventory

### Blended

Sometimes a UI will have both diagetic and non-diagetic components. For instance, a computer terminal in the world, but the actual UI is non-diagetic. Another variation might be a non-diagetic UI that's given justification diagetically, such as with augmented reality.

This wouldn't include UI that involves interacting with an object in the world, where it behaves like that object, but takes up the full screen.

Examples: Deus Ex (all) Security Panels
