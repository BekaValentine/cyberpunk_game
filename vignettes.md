# Vignettes

Vignettes are little snippets of scene from movies, TV shows, pentesting talks,  etc. that exemplify certain mechanics and are useful for documenting what has to be possible in the game.

Some vignettes are straight examples, while others are counter-examples of what not to do.

## Counterexample: Watchdogs 2 Keycards

In mission 1 of WD2, you have to get into a server room, and to do this you have to first get a keycard for an RFID reader. Rather than having to find an actual physical keycard in a desk drawer or swipe one from someones belt or copy it from them as they're sitting in the bathroom, or whatever, you have to hack a computer to get the key card info. But rather than having to somehow get access to the computer in any sensible way, you hop from camera to camera and then get access to the computer.

## Example: Deviant Ollam Keycards

On a pentest, Deviant had to get keycard access to a building. He knew that the employees often have their keycards on their belts, so he went into the lobby dressed appropriately and eventually ends up asking if he can use the bathroom. They direct him to the bathroom, and he sits inside for a while, waiting for people to come in and use the toilets. Eventually someone sits down at the toilet next to him and there's a keycard on his belt, which is now down by the bottom of the stall wall, so Deviant can get a read off the card.

## Example: Bugging Ellingson Minerals

In Hackers, the protagonists bug Ellingson Minerals. To do this, they first have to get information. Acid Burn and Crash Override go trashing, and find some printouts from Ellingson with useful network information, and then get seen by a rentacop, so Burn shoots a flare gun at his guard house, and they escape in the confusion. Meanwhile, Lord Nikon and Cereal Killer raid a phone company truck for equipment and gear, and also get busted this time by a phone company employee, who they distract by yelling "TRUCK!" and pointing, which scares him because he's just coming out of a manhole. Eventually they get together and look through all of the information they got, and Cereal goes into Ellingson dressed as a phone company, there to do some maintenance, which turns out to be bugging people's systems. Meanwhile, Nikon is delivering flowers to a random person under the guise of a courier, which lets him spot people typing their passwords, which he then remembers.

## Example: Deus Ex - Mission - NSF Generator

Goal: find the NSF generator and shut it down

Means: Talking to people to get more info, exploring, sneaking into the warehouse or fighting your way in, disabling the generator

## Example: Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Mission - Neural Hub

Goal: get the neural hub from the Purity First hacker

Means: Getting access to the police station by SE, stealth, combat, tunnels, etc. 

### Logic behind the mission

1. Purity First breaks into factory, which leads to...
2. Discovery of hacker who is himself hacked, which leads to...
3. Following the transmission to its local source in Highland Park, a secret FEMA camp, which leads to...
4. Visiting Heng Sha to find Van Bruggen to find out who hired him, which leads to...
5. Breaking into Tai Yong, to get access to Zhao Yun Ru

## Deus Ex 1 Plot Analysis

High-level analysis: Initially you're working for UNATCO, but eventually you discover, with the help of your brother, that UNATCO is part of a large plot to control and manipulate the governments of the world and their populations, by using the Grey Death, and it's cure Ambrosia, to hold governments hostage, so you defect. After defecting, your primary goal is to stop the Grey Death from spreading. Once that's achieved, you find a way to cure it for everyone, and defeat Bob Page, preventing him from establishing himself as permanent cyber-dictator of Earth.

### Part 1

In Part 1, you're working for UNATCO. Most of the missions here are driven by UNATCO's current operations in NYC in response to the NSF stealing a shipment of Ambrosia.

These missions are mostly disconnected from the larger story, except insofar as they offer you a chance to get the texture of the world and the main groups in it.

- 1st Mission: Liberty Island
  - Goal: Locate and neutralize the NSF threat in the Statue of Liberty. The assumption until this point is that they have the stolen Ambrosia here still, and you're trying to retrieve it.
- 2nd Mission: Battery Park, Hell's Kitchen, and Warehouse District
  - Battery Park:
    - Goal: Locate the Ambrosia; free the subway hostages.
  - Hell's Kitchen/Warehouse District
    - Goal: Locate the NSF headquarters and shut down the generator powering their EMP field in order to allow a raid on the HQ.
    - Sidequest: Free Ford Schick from the secret MJ12 base underground.
- 3rd Mission: Brooklyn Bridge Station, Mole Tunnels, and LaGuardia Airport
  - Goal: Investigate the underground hideout of the NSF, locate the helibase and find missing Ambrosia, find Lebedev and kill him
- 4th Mission: Hell's Kitchen (Second Visit) and NSF Headquarters
  - Goal: Send the signal to Silhouette, possiby save Paul.

### Part 2

In Part 2, you're working against UNATCO/MJ12/Bob Page, with most of the focus being on the spread of the Grey Death.

- 5th Mission: Secret MJ12 Facility and UNATCO Headquarters
  - Goal: Escape the MJ12 base/UNATCO HQ
- 6th Mission: Hong Kong
  - Goal: Win the trust of Tracer Tong to save you and your brother, destroy the VersaLife universal constructor that's manufacturing the Grey Death, get info on where the shipment of the Grey Death is headed
- 7th Mission: Hell's Kitchen (Third Visit)
  - Goal: Contact Stanton Dowd who can tell you where the Grey Death shipment is located
- 8th Mission: Brooklyn Naval Shipyards and Lower East Side Cemetery
  - Naval Yards:
    - Goal: Destroy the ship and the shipment of the Grey Death
  - Cemetary:
    - Goal: Talk to Dowd, get info on the next clues about the Grey Death, escape to Paris
  
  ### Part 3

  In Part 3, your focus is on finding a cure for the grey death, and defeating Bob Page.

- 9th Mission: Paris Streets and Chateau DuClare
  - Goal: Contact Nicolette DuClare and find out info on where Morgan Everett is, help Everett get necessary info to find a cure to the Grey Death
  - Sidequest: Contact and assist Silhouette
- 10th Mission: Knights Templar Cathedral and Morgan Everett's Home
  - Goal: Help Everett get access to the Templar computer needed to cure the Grey Death
- 11th Mission: Vandenberg Air Force Base
  - Goal: Free the base and find out from the scientists of X-51 what they need to get their universal constructor up and running so they can manufacture the cure to the Grey Death
- 12th Mission: Sub Base, Ocean Lab, and Missile Silo
  - Sub Base, Ocean Lab:
    - Goal: Get schematics necessary to finish the X-51 universal constructor
  - Missile Silo:
    - Goal: Stop launch of missile targtting X-51, redirect missile to Area 51
- 13th Mission: Area 51
  - Goal: Confront and defeat Bob Page

### Backward chaining

Why does it take all of this to stop Bob Page? A backward chaining analysis might help answer this.

1. Goal: Stop Page, cure the Grey Death
2. How? You don't just magically have the cure on hand.
3. By synthesizing it.
4. How? You don't know the cure, nor have the means to synthesize it.
5. Get the info, and get a synthesizer/universal constructor.
6. Where is the info? Where is the constructor?
7. You get the info from/with Everett, and the constructor from X-51/the ocean lab

### Main Story Beats

1. Defect from UNATCO (Motivating the backward chaining questions "why? what's the immediate fallout?")
2. Stop the spread of the Grey Death (Motivating the backward chaining questions "how? how do you know?")
3. Cure the Grey Death/Defeat Page (Motivating the backward chaining questions "how? how do you know?")
