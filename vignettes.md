# Vignettes

Vignettes are little snippets of scene from movies, TV shows, pentesting talks,  etc. that exemplify certain mechanics and are useful for documenting what has to be possible in the game.

Some vignettes are straight examples, while others are counter-examples of what not to do.

## Counterexample: Watchdogs 2 Keycards

In mission 1 of WD2, you have to get into a server room, and to do this you have to first get a keycard for an RFID reader. Rather than having to find an actual physical keycard in a desk drawer or swipe one from someones belt or copy it from them as they're sitting in the bathroom, or whatever, you have to hack a computer to get the key card info. But rather than having to somehow get access to the computer in any sensible way, you hop from camera to camera and then get access to the computer.

## Example: Deviant Ollam Keycards

On a pentest, Deviant had to get keycard access to a building. He knew that the employees often have their keycards on their belts, so he went into the lobby dressed appropriately and eventually ends up asking if he can use the bathroom. They direct him to the bathroom, and he sits inside for a while, waiting for people to come in and use the toilets. Eventually someone sits down at the toilet next to him and there's a keycard on his belt, which is now down by the bottom of the stall wall, so Deviant can get a read off the card.

## Example: Bugging Ellingson Minerals

In Hackers, the protagonists bug Ellingson Minerals. To do this, they first have to get information. Acid Burn and Crash Override go trashing, and find some printouts from Ellingson with useful network information, and then get seen by a rentacop, so Burn shoots a flare gun at his guard house, and they escape in the confusion. Meanwhile, Lord Nikon and Cereal Killer raid a phone company truck for equipment and gear, and also get busted this time by a phone company employee, who they distract by yelling "TRUCK!" and pointing, which scares him because he's just coming out of a manhole. Eventually they get together and look through all of the information they got, and Cereal goes into Ellingson dressed as a phone company, there to do some maintenance, which turns out to be bugging people's systems. Meanwhile, Nikon is delivering flowers to a random person under the guise of a courier, which lets him spot people typing their passwords, which he then remembers.

## Example: Deus Ex - Mission - NSF Generator

Goal: find the NSF generator and shut it down

## Example: Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Mission - Neural Hub

Goal: get the neural hub from the Purity First hacker

Means: Getting access to the police station by SE, stealth, combat, tunnels, etc.
