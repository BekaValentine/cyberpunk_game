# Beka Valentine's Game Design Commandments

## There Are No Superheroes

The player character becomes the driving force in the story because they make a choice to do something, to make the world better in some way, not because they are inherently special. Anything remotely like specialness means the player has no role in it, and exists mostly to make the player feel special and superior. But there are no special superior people in the world, there are people making choices. If the player comes into an immersive sim with real world knowledge and can play the game with that, then we shouldn't introduce fake super heroes. Plus, the player can then be reminded that they can make choieces IN THE REAL WORLD TOO.

## Knowledge Flows Both Ways

Every Immersive Sim lets the player bring their knowledge of how the world works into the game and succeed with it. A good Immersive Sim lets the player learn stuff in the game and bring that knowledge back out into the real world. The best Immersive Sims of the future do this not just with background knowledge and lore, but also with the core game mechanics themselves.

## Realism In Actions

The player character must never do things that are implausible for the real world analog of those characters to do. If a person in that role in real life doesn't go around and shoot people or knock people unconscious on a regular basis, then neither should the player.

## Realism In Responses To Actions

Whenever the player character does something extreme like shooting someone or whatnot, that must have appropriately real responses. A secret agent character might shoot someone, but what impact does that have on them, how does a real secret agent have to deal with killing someone, etc.? Most games, even most immersive sims, just let it slide or only have local reactions from NPCs. But in real life, such actions will absolutely have major consequences beyond just the local NPCs around the player character, and so the game should have those too.

## No UI Trash

Non-diagetic UI is fine but most games have just way too much of it. If there is a real world analog for the information source -- eg a map -- then that should be how its presented in the game. Any HUD shit must be justified, either as representations of the player characters intuitions that the player themself simply can't access, or as in-game AR, or something like that. Same for other aspects of UI in the world, like quest markers, interaction highlights, etc.

## Health and Damage

Health and damage must be realistic. People don't just magically regain health in five minutes. But also, medkits don't exist in real life that heals you. If the player character is hurt, they must be impaired realistically and not magically get over it, or be healed, unless there is some in-game justification for it.

## Players Have Skills, Player Characters Enact Those Skills

Do not ever have a "skill tree" or "skill points" or any trash like that. All skills are skills that the player, and NOT the player character, acquires. Nothing gets easier simply because the player character levels up, it only gets easier because the player develops a genuine skill for the game. The only caveat is that if a skill literally cannot be a player skill because its unable to be conveyed by the medium (eg lockpicking is tactile so you cannot convey it with sight and sound) then MAYBE the player character can have the skill, but skill improvement is not skill point allocation, it comes from the equivalent of practice only, and is not displayed anywhere except indirectly through how successful the character is at the actions. That being said, these skills must not be vacuous -- they must not be skills mad up simply to have skills in the player. All of the skills must be motivated by diagetically justified things. Random arbitrary constraints are bad.

## Players Achieve, Player Characters Enact Those Achievements

Do not ever have a challenge that the player is confronted with that is overcome by the actions or qualities of the player character. If something is difficult to do, it must be difficult for the player, not the player character. If something is endured, it is endured by the player not the player character. If that's not obviously possible, find ways to make it possible, change the game so that it becomes possible, has some analog that can make it roughly possible, or cut it out entirely. Only make an achievement a player character achievement if there's no other option.

## Players Know And Decide, Player Characters Enact Knowledge And Decisions

Do not ever have the player character simply offer up information to the player, as if remembering for the player. For example, door codes in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. If the player learns something, they must recall it when its needed. It's fine to have an info repository in the game of things that the player has learned, so long as its justifiable -- a map in the players phone or notes, fine, but a conversation log, no, not unless the player explicitly activated a recording device. Memory and knowledge belongs to the player only, not the player character.

## Simulation Depth Must Maximize Fun

If a core mechanic's simulation is too shallow, that can be extremely boring. Increase the depth until its fun. But if its too deep, it might also be unfun. For instance, lock picking becomes extremely unfun when its simulated too deeply, because lock picking in real life is a fundamentally tactile thing, and all the deep simulations have to make up some nonsense. Don't do this, just make it a click and an animation.
