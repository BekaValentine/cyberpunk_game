# Modelling Tasks

These are the objects that will need to be modelled.

There is some logic to some of this. Namely, we can determine what objects need to be modelled by thinking about places and activities and so forth, and thinking about what things are frequently there. You can also figure out things to model by looking at, e.g. Ikea, but that'll only give a subset of things that aren't especially equipment-like.
