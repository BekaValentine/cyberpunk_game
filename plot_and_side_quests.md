# Plot and Side Quests

A recap of the main questions of the game:

  - What's more important, Doing The Right Thing, or Following The Rules?
  - How important is it to get Permission To Act?
  - Do the Needs Of The Many outway the Needs Of The Few/One?
  - What's more important, Principles or Wealth?
  - What's more important, People or Corporations/Property?
  - What's more important, Doing The Right Thing even if it cost you, or Ignoring Bad Things but keeping yourself safe?
  - When confronted with injustice (either a personal injustice or an unjust system), do you Try To Make The World Better or do you Keep Your Head Down And Survive?

What is the relationship between these?

Most important is:

When confronted with an unjust system, do you Try To Make The World Better or do you Keep Your Head Down And Survive?

Subsidiary to that, which can motivate sub-quests as a leadup to the main quest, is:

- When confronted with a personal injustice, do you Try To Make The World Better or do you Keep Your Head Down And Survive?

Subsidiary to all of these, serving them, are the questions

  - What's more important, Doing The Right Thing, or Following The Rules?
  - How important is it to get Permission To Act?
  - Do the Needs Of The Many outway the Needs Of The Few/One?
  - What's more important, Principles or Wealth?
  - What's more important, People or Corporations/Property?
  - What's more important, Doing The Right Thing even if it cost you, or Ignoring Bad Things but keeping yourself safe?

We can collapse some of these probably like so:

  Q: How important is it to get Permission To Act?
  
  folds into

  Q: What's more important, Doing The Right Thing, or Following The Rules?

  because Acting is the Right Thing, asking permission is Following The Rules

  similarly

  Q: What's more important, Doing The Right Thing even if it cost you, or Ignoring Bad Things but keeping yourself safe?

  folds into the main two questions

The remainders are choices between two conflicting values. So:

  - What's more important, Doing The Right Thing, or Following The Rules?
    - Right Thing = acting to make the world better
    - Following The rules = obeying the law, getting permission from people in authority
  - Other versions of what's more important?
    - Principles vs Wealth
    - People vs Corportions/Property
    - Needs of the Many vs Needs of the Few/One (this should always be secretly a false dichotomy!)

Most plot subquests should ask a Doing The Right Thing kinds of questions, sometimes multiple at once.

Many plot subquests should ask AT LEAST ONE Other Whats More important questions as well.

## Main Plot

The main plot is about the character progressing through their arc from a Hack Not Crime sort of person, who believes that hacking can be a pure and innocent thing that simply involves security, and eventually becomes radicalized into believing that hacking is inherently criminalized and that the only way to liberate people is to fight capitalism's excesses.

- PC is a new pentester at a company, does some jobs
- Loved one of PC has an aug, it stops working because they can't afford the new software subscriptions, so it reduces their medical options to the free version, they start to die, and PC has a choice of either helping them break the DRM/etc. or take out an obnoxiously expensive personal loan to fund it.
- PC decides to get revenge and eventually joins an underground movement
- PC engages in progressively bigger missions to expose corporate evil, and defend the oppressed, culminating first in an opportunity to go against the original company that killed their loved one, and then to destroy the entire regime of DRM control over computers and augments and 3d printers. TODO flesh this out

The first of three parts culminates with the player stumbling across some evidence of a bigger corporate conspiracy that involves like DRM backdoors and AI spyware. The Conspiracy is investigated and fleshed out in the second part of the game, and its scale and goals are discovered at the end of that part: spy on every computer and phone in the world in order to gather compromising material, financial secrets, plant incriminating data, etc. allowing the Conspiracists to influence and manipulate economies and governments. The third part of the game is about the race to stop The Conspiracy.

Hints at the conspiracy along the way can be things like destabilization of foreign or smaller economies, foreign governments collapsing from data leaks, big corporate data/tech thefts (that the player can be involved in), etc. Bigger anomalous events should come later in the story to hint at the test runs getting bigger and bigger.

Perhaps we discover the existence of the backdoor (but not the details of it yet) by doing two or three jobs over the course of Act 1 that reveal a mysterious, inexplicable backdoor on some computer, and then we culminate with a trace of the backdoor to a hacker's secret lair and fine evidence that the backdoor is in hundreds or thousands of computers, and he's being paid to do it by some big mysterious outside party. To keep him quiet, they have him assassinated.

NOTE: EVERYTHING ABOVE IS IN FLUX MOSTLY. I like the idea of the pentesting job, the sick loved one, etc. but I'm not sure how to fit that into the broader motivation. I don't know what can motivate the PC to do things in all branches. Namely:

  Suppose the PC stays with the corporation and doesn't manage to save their loved one. What then motivates anything that's happening?
  Suppose they don't stay, but do save them, etc.?
  In games like DX, you're sort of forced by the game: the next mission *is* this, you either do it or quit the game. In a slightly more branching game, is that possible?????
  One POSSIBLE resolution is: every path you don't take has a matching NPC who ends up making their version of the choice and taking up the dual role. If you stay in the corp, you become responsible for helping secure the companies being targetted by the rebels, etc.

## Side Quests

Side quests will be either mandatory -- the PC's work assignments, which simultaneously function to train the player on new techniques, and also give them opportunity to gain access to various places that might benefit them later -- or optional -- PC's acquaintances offer sidequests.

- optional side quests
  - urbexing -- should offer rewards for exploration that benefit later gameplay
  - topical missions not directly related to the work of the underground
- mandatory side quests: misc. different corporations
