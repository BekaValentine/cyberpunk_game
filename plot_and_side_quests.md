# Plot and Side Quests

## Main Plot

The main plot is about the character progressing through their arc from a Hack Not Crime sort of person, who believes that hacking can be a pure and innocent thing that simply involves security, and eventually becomes radicalized into believing that hacking is inherently criminalized and that the only way to liberate people is to fight capitalism's excesses.

- PC is a new pentester at a company, does some jobs
- Loved one of PC has an aug, it stops working because they can't afford the new software subscriptions, so it reduces their medical options to the free version, they start to die, and PC has a choice of either helping them break the DRM/etc. or take out an obnoxiously expensive personal loan to fund it.
- PC decides to get revenge and eventually joins an underground movement
- PC engages in progressively bigger missions to expose corporate evil, and defend the oppressed, culminating first in an opportunity to go against the original company that killed their loved one, and then to destroy the entire regime of DRM control over computers and augments and 3d printers. TODO flesh this out

NOTE: EVERYTHING ABOVE IS IN FLUX MOSTLY. I like the idea of the pentesting job, the sick loved one, etc. but I'm not sure how to fit that into the broader motivation. I don't know what can motivate the PC to do things in all branches. Namely:

  Suppose the PC stays with the corporation and doesn't manage to save their loved one. What then motivates anything that's happening?
  Suppose they don't stay, but do save them, etc.?
  In games like DX, you're sort of forced by the game: the next mission *is* this, you either do it or quit the game. In a slightly more branching game, is that possible?????
  One POSSIBLE resolution is: every path you don't take has a matching NPC who ends up making their version of the choice and taking up the dual role. If you stay in the corp, you become responsible for helping secure the companies being targetted by the rebels, etc.

## Side Quests

Side quests will be either mandatory -- the PC's work assignments, which simultaneously function to train the player on new techniques, and also give them opportunity to gain access to various places that might benefit them later -- or optional -- PC's acquaintances offer sidequests.

- optional side quests
  - urbexing -- should offer rewards for exploration that benefit later gameplay
  - topical missions not directly related to the work of the underground
- mandatory side quests: misc. different corporations
