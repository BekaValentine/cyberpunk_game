# Inspectable Objects Notes

Some objects should be inspectable. Ideally this wouldn't require a special screen?

Perhaps the right way to do this is to move into a mode where the inspected object is focused and large, and then interactions with it are just clicks, possibly with a tool in hand.

Idea: Inspecting things normally is by looking at it, which generally will be an upright activity aimed at things away from the player character. Inspecting something in the player character's hand will involve looking very far down, which brings any held tool into focus as the inspectable object.

## Plausible Inspectables

- Books, Magazines, News Papers???, Documents
  - inspection means to read the item. interactions are page turns, maybe highlighting or dogear-ing? no tools needed
- Keys
  - inspection means to look at the key from various angles. interactions are to rotate to different angles
  - could yield info about the bitting code, the marks on the keys from impressioning, etc.
  - tools could be measuring tools, filing or cutting tools
- Key Cards???
  - inspection means to look at the keycard from various angles. interactions are to rotate
  - could yield info about the keycard protocol, frequency, manufacturer, model, etc.
  - tools could be reading a writing with an RFID inspector gadget
- Devices?
  - inspection means to look at various angles
  - could yield info about serial number, model, ports, etc.
- Interfaces?
  - inspection means to look at it close up
  - tools could be pressing buttons and removing screws and plugging things in and removing things?
