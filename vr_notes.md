# vr notes

VR systems should use SQUID headsets instead of over-the-eye headsets

low-end headsets are more casette futurism, bigger, bulkier. mid-range are a little slimmer and more gen x corporate or stream line modern industrial design, but still decently bulky. high end sets for rich people are very slim and almost like jewelry.

poor people basically never get VR augmentations. tech workers get them routinely b/c they can afford them and often have relevant jobs. rich people basically never get them because they would never get a semi-permanent implant that might need to be replaced in a few years, but they can also afford the truly expensive headsets that they normally would use.
