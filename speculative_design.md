## Methodology

Q: How do we develop the initial lists of things below? The 1-n givens?
A:
    1. Knowing about the world, about hobbyists, about new products, new patents, new science
    2. Knowing about social movements, political trends, economic trends, etc. 

Q: How do we make inferences?
A: By way of some basic principles:

   - Capitalists will continue to capitalist, anti-capitalists will anti-capitalist, etc.
   - Technology generally improves, computer technology does so especially in Moore-ish/Kurzweilian exponentials
   - Time passes, people still have their basic needs, desites, etc.

Q: What are good questions to ask about a potential new technology?
A:
    1. What does it look like when it's cheap and widespread?
    2. How can it be used for bad things, abused, used for harm, exploitation, etc.?
    3. How can it be used for good things, liberatory or beautiful things?
    4. How can it be used for art, media, daily life, work, recreation, sex, fashion?
    5. How can capitalists exploit it for profit? How can anti-capitalists resist?

Q: What are good questions to ask about a technological or social trend?
A:
    1. What happens if it continues, or if it stops? What extremes can it lead to?
    2. How will capitalists find ways to profit from it?
    3. How can it be technologized or financialized?
    4. How can it play into civil rights?
    5. How do these trends intersect with class, race, gender, sexuality, etc.?

## Retro-future design examples

Examples of attempts to answer the question: what would it take for someone in the past to have accurately predicted the future we're in right now?

### Piracy, DRM, Copyright Wars

Given early 80s knowledge of:

1. Minor software piracy debates (eg Bill Gates' letter to the Homebrew Computer Club, videogame copy protection)
2. Moore's Law for computers broadly -- computers get faster, more powerful, have more memory
3. Nascent network connections
4. Underground radio, movie piracy
5. ATTs history of trying to block compatible hardware

Predict:

6. Computers will be orders of magnitude faster and more powerful (from 2, progress)
7. Widespread networks will emerge, and will be fast (from 2, 3)
8. More things will be transferable over the network -- more files, larger files, lots more data in lots less time (from 6, 7)
9. Piracy will continue or spread -- anything that can be seen as data: not just software and games, but books, images, music, TV and movies (from 1, 6, 8)

Also predict:

10. Capitalists will try to stop the piracy (from 1, capitalism)
  - How?
    - Laws
    - Stronger copy locks
11. People will fight back against it in various ways (from 10, humanity)
  - How?
    - Illegal, more piracy, more pirating software and tools
    - Legal, advocacy groups, etc.
12. Software locks will extend to more software broadly speaking not just consumer oriented software, and so from (from 5, 10, capitalism)
  will infect anything that *has* software
13. More and more things are made to run software just to put copylocks on them to prevent competitors, etc. (from 12, capitalism)
  
### Smartphones

Given early 90s knowledge of:

1. Moore's Law for computers broadly -- computers get faster, more powerful, have more memory
2. Nascent network connections
3. Nascent cell phones
4. Nascent PDAs
5. Nascent handheld videogames
6. Media is just data

Predict:

7. Computers will be orders of magnitude faster and more powerful (from 1, progress)
8. Widespread networks will emerge, and will be fast (from 2)
9. Cellphones and PDAs will start to merge and become general purpose computing devices (from 2, 3, 7)
10. These smartphones will be used for entertainment, from videogames to movies to TV to music (from 5, 6, 8, 9)

### Widespread 3D Printers

Given early 90s knowledge of:

1. Rapid prototyping tools / Stratasys 3d printers

Predict:

2. Cost and size will shrink (from 1, progress)
3. Patents will expire (from 1, time)
4. Wide commercialization will happen (from 2, 3, capitalism)
5. Hobbyist ecosystem will emerge (from 2, 4)
